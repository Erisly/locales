# Translation Instructions
- Do not translate commands. Commands must remain the same across languages. (E.g. >ping will always remain the same)
- Do not translate words used in commands. Words such as "coins", "tower", "gifts", "Supporter Tickets", "Golden Tickets" and more are the names of commands and/or are nouns and should not be translated to remain consistent.
- Do not translate the word "PikaGirl".
- Please maintain markdown formatting. You will sometimes see extra characters around strings. These must be maintained across translations. Examples include:
    - `*Hi! My name is PikaGirl! This text is in italics.*`
