# Translation Instructions
- Do not translate commands. Commands must remain the same across languages. (E.g. >ping will always remain the same)
- Do not translate words used in commands. Words such as "coins", "tower", "gifts", "Supporter Tickets", "Golden Tickets" and more are the names of commands and/or are nouns and should not be translated to remain consistent.
- Do not translate the word "Erisly".
- Please maintain markdown formatting. You will sometimes see extra characters around strings. These must be maintained across translations. Examples include:
    - `*Hi! My name is Erisly! This text is in italics.*`
    - `**Hi! My name is Erisly! This text is in bold.**`
    - `__Hi! My name is Erisly! This text has an underline.__`
    - `Hi! My name is Erisly!\nThis is a new line seperated by \n.`
    - `` `Hi! My name is Erisly! This text is in a small code block.` ``
    - `<Hi! My name is Erisly! This text is an escaped link.>`
    - `[Hi! My name is Erisly! This is a link.](https://erisly.com)`
- Variables are indicated as `{{{variable}}}` or sometimes as `%s`. Do not translate these as these indicate variables for Erisly to replace when run. Please maintain these across translations.
    - For example: `Erisly has {{{amount}}} apples.` will become `Erisly has 5 apples.` when run.
    - For example: `%s hours` will become `5 hours` when run.
